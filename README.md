# Project Overview: Real-Time Social Media Sentiment Dashboard

## Data Ingestion & Scalable Computing (Big Data Component):

Use a distributed computing framework like PySpark or Dask to ingest and preprocess a large dataset from social media sources (e.g., Twitter).
This ensures you can efficiently handle streaming or batch data at scale.
- Using snscrape to mine tweets
- using pyspark to injest data 

## Deep Learning & NLP (Transformer-Based Analysis):

Leverage a transformer model (using libraries like Hugging Face) to perform sentiment analysis on the ingested text data.
Fine-tune a pre-trained model (e.g., BERT or DistilBERT) to classify sentiments accurately, capturing nuances in language.

## End-to-End Deployment & Production Readiness:

Develop an API using a lightweight framework such as FastAPI to serve your sentiment analysis model.
Containerize the entire pipeline (data processing, model inference, and API) using Docker to ensure smooth deployment and scalability.

## Interactive Visualization & Dashboarding:

Build an interactive dashboard using tools like Streamlit or Plotly Dash to display real-time sentiment trends, geographic heatmaps, or time series of sentiment scores.
This dashboard could allow users to filter data by time, topic, or location, giving them a hands-on view of the analysis.


## How It All Ties Together
Pipeline Flow:
Raw social media data → distributed ingestion and preprocessing → sentiment analysis using a deep learning model → serving predictions through an API → interactive dashboard for visualization.

## Benefits:

Scalability: Handle large, real-time datasets with PySpark/Dask.
Advanced Analytics: Use state-of-the-art transformer models for nuanced NLP tasks.
Production-Ready: Containerization and API development show your ability to deploy models in a real-world setting.
User Engagement: An interactive dashboard makes the insights accessible and actionable.
